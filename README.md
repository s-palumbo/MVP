# Paint "Quick Reference" Training Aid
## Built for Scenario Labs LLC. by Shannon Palumbo

- This app is designed as a flow-chart style "quick reference guide" for preparing various substrates for finish paint in the Scenario Labs paint department, based on the company's specific product library and work-flow. 

- It is intended to be used with the assumption that the painter has already received essential training and is not meant to be a stand-alone training tool. 

- The database is designed to be scalable, so that materials, steps, and products can be continuously updated. 

## Tech Specs / Stack 

- The flowchart is built on a MySQL database with a "description" for the substrate, options for three "TEXT" branches with variables the user may encounter, and three corresponding "NEXT" options which point to the IDs of the next appropriate step.

 - The back-end tools used are Node.js and Express.

 - The front end is developed with React and styled using TailwindCSS.


## SETUP

### Dependencies:

- Run `npm install` in the project directory to install server dependencies. 
- `cd client` and run `npm install` to install client dependencies.

### Database

- Access your MySQL interface by running `mysql -u root -p` in your terminal. 

- Create a `.env` file to your project folder. The name of the database is `mvp` 

```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=mvp
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
```

- run `npm migrate` which will import the table called `steps` and all of the currently existing data. 

- The `"model"` folder contains an `init_db.sql` file which contains the information for the table as well as in insert statement in case it's needed as backup or there's a problem importing the database. 

## Development

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 4000
- In another terminal, `cd client` and run `npm run dev` to start the client in development mode with on port 5173. 


## Resources for further development:

The Matthews Paint Company Website has "substrate preparation guide" with substantially in-depth guidance to pull from to add to the database. 

- [Matthews Paint Co](https://docs.matthewspaint.info/substrate-application-guide/)

I made a Google Sheets Doc to rough sketch the connections between steps and step IDS:

The TailwindCSS site has good documentation to continue with consistent styling:
